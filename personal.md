Extended biography

// TODO: make this click to show 

I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1997.  I had a pretty normal childhood.
I played several sports, a lot of video games, and a lot of TV.

As a kid, I think I mostly started
of pretty studious until about 7th grade.  Then I felt like I wasted a lot of time
until and watched too much Netflix and played too many video games until about 
10th or 11th grade.  Then I felt like in college, I got a lot more studious
and pretty serious about some things.

I played several sports like soccer and basketball growing up, and I also still
do stuff like skiing and mountain biking.  In high school I got pretty in to 
tennis and I played a lot and got pretty good.  I wish I ran track in high
school (it conflicted with tennis season), because I would have been fast.
I could run like the wind blows.

In high school, I also took AP/IB courses and did pretty well in school, but mostly
wasted a lot of time, and also too much Netflix bingeing and Call oF Duty. 

I had a few really great teachers there that I think really helped me not waste 
all of my time.

Then I ended up at the university of utah and stated in mechanical engineering,
but switched to compute engineering after a year of working on the robotics team
and realized I thought that stuff was way cooler.
