I grew up and went to university in [Salt Lake City](https://www.google.com/search?q=salt+lake+city), [Utah](https://www.google.com/search?q=utah).
I lived in [Pittsburgh](https://www.google.com/search?q=pittsburgh), [Pennsylvania](https://www.google.com/search?q=pennsylvania) during Summer 2017.
I lived in [Vancouver](https://www.google.com/search?q=vancouver), Canada for a year (Aug 2019-2020).
And now I am back home in SLC for COVID  ðŸ˜·
