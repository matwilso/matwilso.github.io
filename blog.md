</div>
A more complete vision of the future of robot learning from the perspective of large predictive models. More discussion of both model-based RL and sim2real and how they relate.

</div>
Some of my earlier thoughts on a learned simulator and how it might look, trying to extrapolate from things we were seeing with GPT-3.
Some duplicate content with later posts, so I would start with those and come back to this if you are really hungry for more.
