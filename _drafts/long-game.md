title: The Long Game
permalink: /long-game/

The time between senior year of high school and freshman year of college is
exciting.  It is like being freed and entering this cool new place.  The
possibilities are much greater and it feels like you can do anything.  At this
time, I was really mistaken.

I was learning to code and I was excited and I had all these thoughts in my
head from watching the social network and how Zuck invents facebook and makes
a million dollars while still like a sophomore in college or something.

I thought I could learn to code in a few months, make a quick mobile app that
hits it big and make a million dollars.  



It is all about the long game.
Things take time.
