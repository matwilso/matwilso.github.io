title: The brain as a state machine

At the lowest level of the brain, at the smallest increment of time, it is
just biochemical reactions.  A neuron potential flows. A cell is activated.
It is essentially a big jumble of circuitry.  Some signals flow in to different
regions and some signals flow out of certain regions.

If you think about it in the smallest time step, it is just a state machine.
In that case, how are we able to make decisions? It seems that if everything is
based on the past state of the brain, in a recursive proof, the state at the
beginning would determine the entire state and actions of the brain.

The thing missing from this is the input to the brain at each time step.  The
brain takes input in the form of processed sensory input, primarily sight and
sound.  This is the conditioning for the brain, so it also contributes to the
state of the brain at any point.

So everything you do, and in fact everything you see and experience contributes
to the state of your brain and what you are able to do.  This means that it is
very important for you to spend your time on things that improves the state of
your brain.  You are only able to do things if your brain is ready.  The
brain is just a state machine, so to achieve great things, you have to put
your brain in a state that it is able to do things.

But back to understanding intelligence.

If the brain is just a state machine at any time, then how do you make
decisions.  At a higher level, how do human brains decide to do something.
It feels like you can do anything at any time.  That you have unlimited
choices.  But how does this work if you brain is just in a single state?  How
is it that you can have multiple choices and decide from these, when your
brain is just progressing from one state to the next?
