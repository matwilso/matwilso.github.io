How to be productive


This essay is meant for somebody decently motivated that is trying to expand
what they are working on and learn new things, and has traditionally "wasted
their potential" by squandering their time watching tele, or playing too much 
video games.  This includes a former version of myself.

Realize that it takes a lot of time

The time it takes for somebody or a group to achieve something is often
abstracted away.  For projects that others work on, you see no details of what 
goes on to create the finished product.  All you see is the end result, so 
things are extremely abstracted from you.  

Take the example of Facebook, popularized through the movie the 
*The Social Network*. Before even seeing the movie, the story of Facebook is 
that some wiz kids created it and dropped out of Harvard.


The effect of this is that you aren't able to 
appreciate the difficulty of things and will often give up after finding that
something takes any effort. It gives you a short-sightedness that will prevent
you from pursuing anything that really matters. 

...And, even when you are doing something yourself, it is extremely hard to 
predict how long things will take.
