title: Getting starting with OpenAI gym and Deep Reinforcement Learning
permalink: /gym-intro/
---


This is a Jupyter notebook to show how fun it is to mess around with deep
reinforcement learning for training agents
to play games.

If you are unfamiliar with Juptyer, it is an interactive way to run python code.
 A Jupyter notebook is made up of cells of python code, you can click on the
  cells and type `SHIFT+ENTER` and the code inside will get run.

Jupyter is a great tool for scientific research and trying out things quickly.
 You can easily make changes.





There are a [million][1] [different][2] [resources][3] [for][4] [deep][5]
[learning][6] [and][7] [reinforcement][8] [learning][9] [out][10] [there][11].

This post is meant to help you to get your feet wet with gym and to start
being able to explore and mess around with deep learning and real "games",
because that is when it gets fun.

So this is an intro to how to start playing with gym and writing intelligent
agents, using deep learning, to solve an OpenAI environment.


Because it is fun and the coolest thing ever.  Training AI to win a game.
That is just way cool.  When you get to play with it and figure out how it
works, that is exciting.  Then you can create AI.  But unless you really
deeply care about it, you won't get any good.  It is not easy.  You don't
just sit down one day and write AI.  It takes many days and a lot of the
times it is not fun.  You have to do a lot of work before it becomes fun.
But if you enjoy it enough and you believe in it, you can do it.

## Prereqs

To understand this post the most, you should be familiar with calculus, and
deep supervised learning, as for image classification.  You do not need
background on reinforcement learning concepts.

Go see my other post for getting started with deep learning.  It is a
prereq because all of the best methods for solving gym environments use
deep learning.

Depending on your background, this can take a few months to a year.  If you
have taken intro calculus, you could learn it in a year max.  If you have
intro calculus and have at least a year or two of programming experience,
you could learn it 6 months max.  Assuming that you were dedicated enough.

It does take awhile though. There are many prereqs. See my other post.


So first, I will show you what I can do, and then I will show you how you can
get started.


1. Train a neural, using a policy gradient method, to solve the LunarLander
environment.  All running on your computer, and all quickly and you will
be able to mess around and look at how things work.

2. Step through the code

Look through the code and kind of a get a feel for what is going on.
Then move along

3. Step by in a notebook, maybe live hosting. Oh that would make this cool.
A live blog that they could play with.


## Gym

So the OpenAI gym is just a python interface to interact with a bunch of
different environments, meaning you can write code and *mostly* run it
on other environments pretty easily.  The code I will show you does in
fact solve both the CartPole (boring) and the LunarLander (much cooler)
environments.


## The secret weapon

Jupyter Notebooks.  The best fucking thing ever.
