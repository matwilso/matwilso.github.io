How to learn new things


I remember thinking how impossible learning to program seemed to me. It feels 
that you may never be good enough, or that it will just be impossible.


The zeroth step to learning how to do something new is to decidde if you 
actually want to learn that thing.  If you think you might not actually
care about learning to program, or you might lose interest, then it 
probably isn't worth your time. You have to know that you absolutely 
want to learn it.  


You **have** to want to learn it, because for difficult things, the truth 
is they take a ton of time to learn.  You can't expect to learn how to 
program in 1 month.  You may be able to write some programs, but you won't
be any good.  You need to accept it.  The truth is, it will actually take
a lot of time.  If what you want to learn is starting to sound not as fun,
you may want to reevalutate if you want to learn it.


If you do actually want to learn it, and you accept that it will take a lot
of time, then you are well on your way.  The next thing you need to do is
get started.  The quickest way I have found to learn something is to read
as little as you can about and it and just try doing it.  You can read a lot 
about something, but you will never understand it until you do it.  Experience
is the quickest and most efficient way to learn something.


You have to be dedicated. Everyday, you have to work on learning.  If you 
keep coming back to it over long timescales, your brain will reinforce the
ideas.  Over time you will form the neural connections and get better at it.
You have to keep discplined and keep coming back to it.


This essay is shit and I will probably never finish it or really look at it again...
