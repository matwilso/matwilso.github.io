Here are some of my recommendations.  These are things that I have found useful, interesting,
or enjoyable.  YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)


# Evernote

Better than Google Keep.  Things are much more organized.  Notebooks allow longer, more cohesive
long thoughts. Better for daily logs.

Taking notes about everything.  I take daily notes and then certain things if I have things 
that I want to throw in application letters or something like that.  Conversational stuff
(things to talk about).  I have not used any of these yet, but I think they might have use.
Ideas I have for parenting, et cetera.

The biggest use is probably for projects.  For different projects that I do, I have external
storage for thoughts and ideas and kind of paths I was on.

You have to be a bit careful to not overlog, but this may be hard (debatable)

It helps to have a long term mm

# Twitter people to follow

@matwilso.  Some of them I mute because they tweet too frequently or get annoying, but 
many of them I recommend.


## Intro to Neural Networks/Deep Learning

[1] http://cs231n.stanford.edu/, http://cs231n.github.io/

First, Stanford's CS231n course (created by Andrej Karpathy et. al.) has been the best resource for getting into deep learning. The course notes and video lectures are great, but to make it worthwhile you need to go complete all of the assignments. It can be challenging, but it will give you a great introduction and base for gaining deep understanding of cutting edge methods and being able to use them in projects.


Stanford University: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research

Best resource I have found for getting into the details of tensorflow. A lot of people use the low-level api, which is not covered well on the TF website, or is at least hard to find.



### Deep Learning in general


### Reinforcement Learning specifically


## Books and Blogs

2) http://www.hpmor.com/

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Harry Potter fanfic). I lost a good portion of my winter break to binge reading this. If you like it, you will really like it. So probably don't try it until you have a bit of spare time.


3) Essays

Paul Graham has written a ton of great essays. He is a big software and startup guy, but has written more general essays that I have also really loved. This might be a decent place to start: http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html. Then, maybe: http://paulgraham.com/hamming.html, http://paulgraham.com/love.html



4) Half-assing it with everything you've got

Recently, I have gotten into Nate Soares's blog. Linked is probably my favorite post. I also really liked: http://mindingourway.com/where-coulds-go/


2) http://karpathy.github.io/, https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/

Along with 1), basically most of what Andrej Karpathy does is cool and his posts are really great. Highly recommended follow for anyone getting into deep learning and machine intelligence.





## YouTube Channels

Arxiv-Insights
great video on variatonal autoencoders.  also interesting alphago one.
all of them are pretty solid.

3Blue1Brown

Basically just videos on math.  They have some good videos on neural networks

Ben, Ben, and Blue

Just pretty good conversations, about math and education mostly, but also touch on other
things
