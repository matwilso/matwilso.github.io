'What I cannot create, I do not understand'


I think it is true that you do not have a good understanding of something until
you can create it.

For example, I think it is likely that those reading this that have implemented
a neural network understand (at least fairly well) what a neural network is,
and those that haven't probably don't.


Following this line of reasoning, then, it seems that the best route to
understading human-level intelligence is to create it.  Even if you do not
subscribe to this fully, there are many useful analogies that can be gleamed from
studying machine learning.



## Discriminative vs. Generative


## Reinforcement Learning as an framework for life planning

I think Sutton sells this concept well in his textbook.



## Backpropping


need to try it your self, and then get the signal to update

active learning requires that you actually try to find the answer before getting the label



## Data-driven 

It is interesting to look at aspects of life in terms of data.


Like the photos and videos that you take.  That is collecting data of yourself
and what you were doing.

Taking work logs.  Most of that data is just for storage, but you can use some
things to learn about yourself.

Like predicting how much you can get done in a week or what things you want to work on.
And then compare that with what actually happened.
