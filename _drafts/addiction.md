Outline
- If you give a mouse a cookie: the key is to never give the cookie
- dr. jekyll and mr. hyde: Once mr. hyde is in the driver seat, you are toast.
- Need to fully be behind quitting. If you are half-assed, than you just feel 
worse about failing, while not taking any necessary steps to prevent yourself 
from doing it again
- You actually need to take actions and make a real plan to fix it:
  - What exactly is the behavior that you don't like?  Spending several hours watching TV. You are ok with 1 ep, but not 2.
  - What causes it to happen?  In what situations do you find yourself wasting time?
  - How could you prevent yourself from getting in that situation?
  - What is some concrete action that you can take that would reduce your risk?
  - You have to make a pact and stick to it.  Be serious about it and go over it
  not just when you are breaking it, but every day, at times when you are being 
  strong to not break it. Reinforce the good behavior and good results.  Write
  down what you will not do and recite it.  Recite it at easy times and recite it
  before you are about to get into similar situations.


I sit down to watch a single episode, or video, and end up watching 10 in a row.

Part of you feels that it is not that bad and kind of helpful.  There are some
redeeming things about it.  Maybe it lets you relax, and you like humor and like
picking up on the humor, or it is social or something like that.  If it were 
completely useless, you would not do it.  

You were going well for awhile, but you just finished a deadline, or got back 
from a trip, and you quickly fall back in to your old ways.  Unless you have
methods to prevent you from slipping, it happens rapidly.

It is not helpful to stress over the past.  You need to give up on past time
lost.  It is gone forever.  The only thing that you can change is the future.
But to do that, you have to plan.  And not just for right now, because when
you are done, you don't feel like doing it anyways.  You need to plan for the 
next time you will be in a similar situation.

## Should you work to get rid of it?  Do you even care?

Obviously if you are thinking of something right now that you are addicted to,
if you are considering it an addiction, you want to get rid of it.  But it really
does help to ask.  Because part of you probably sees something redeeming in it
if you are still doing it.
