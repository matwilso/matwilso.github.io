This is my index page for robotics related stuff.
It contains links to my robotics-related posts

## Posts
- Learning the Simulator.  How we can improve simulators, for pushing sim2real/simulation learning forward and making system verification easier and more automatic.

irobot, space robots, household robot (jetson).

One thing that excites me about the future is robots that work super well.
I think there are some really exciting prospects.
And that they can be such a constructive technology.
Enabling us to build things.
And clean things and maintain our world.
Hiring robots to clean streets.
Sending robots out to space to help us build things.
Humans die so easily and it is really sad when they do.
Space is extremely dangerous.  But we have to go there because it is so cool!
(And humans are doomed if we don't.  We need this for our future.)
So we can send robots out there to set up our life support system.

In space and in the house are two big examples that I can think.
But I am sure that there are many industrial examples.
Like automating away stevedores.
Led to more efficient international shipping.
That was a super simple fix.

(Hmm.... I wonder how much a lot of failures of our world
are just unsexy things like that.  Shipping containers.  The problem
that Stripe fixes. And maybe your impact would be better there.
I don't think this is the case for robotics.  There is in fact a
problem they are solving.)

And so then if I want that to happen.
What is going to make that happen?

If we imagined we got to the point where we had household robots working.
Where you told them to go to our room and pick up the trash there and throw it away.
How would we get there?

That is what these posts are thinking about.
From a research and technological development point of view,
what will this look like?  How will this get done?

I am writing it to better understand how to build it, but perhaps
better predicting and understanding how these systems will get built
can help in better decision making around how these systems get deployed.
And probably some back and forth between them.


What does the future of robot learning look like?
How are we going to create more capable and general purpose robots?
In this series of posts, I explore how robotics and robot learning might progress in the future.

What does the future of robotics look like?
How are robots useful now, and how could they be useful in the future?

Robots in space and robots in the home.


## Future Posts (Ideas)
- Learning from Demonstration.  Some ideas about how we can learn more from humans.  And how that might look.
- Sim2real engine
- How do traditional simulators work?
- A few review pieces.  Like more what is the current status of the field in robot
learning.  Like cataloging methods.  For example, all learned simulator work.
All sim2real approaches. All learning from demonstrations work.
- Balancing short and long term.  You need to aim towards what the future is going to be (invent the future from the future).  But you also need things to actually work (building out from short-term).  Like you can't get pulled too far from what will actually work.
Especially when you are dealing with more abstract ideas.  I guess mainly following what works.
- Cool things that robots could do in the future.
- Robots in space.  Robotic mining and self-sustaining space civilizations.
