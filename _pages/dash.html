	<h2>Daily regimen</h2>

	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Week (MON-SUN)</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		[7am-8am] Wake up and get down to the lab (1 hr/day; 7 hr/week)
		</li>
		<li>
			[8am-4pm] Work on research (8 hr/day; 56 hr/week). 
			<ul>
			<li>
				Kind of:
			</li>
			<li>
				[9am-4pm] Analyzing tests, doing science, coding
			</li>
			<li>
				[2pm-4pm] Study and read things and take Ankis 
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			[4pm-5pm] Eat
		</li>
		<li>
			[5pm-8pm] Work on side projects, or main if needed (3 hr/day; 21 hr/week)
		</li>
		<li>
			[8pm-11pm] Go home, meal prep, misc bullshit, and read book before bed (3 hr/day; 21 hr/week)
		</li>
		<li>
			[MW] Get to the gym to climb, and maybe lift and run, at ~8, then go home
		</li>
		<li>
			[TH] Go until 8 or 9 depending on mood, then go home and read
		</li>
		<li>
			[F] Handle more misc bullshit this day sometimes, and go climbing with friends at 5pm
		</li>
		<li>
			[SatSu] Best times for working because no distractions. Sometimes chill at night. Infrequently will go out of town
		</li>
	</ul>

	Total workish time, including main work and side = 77 hr/week optimal <br>
	Really have like 7 hours a week of slop (less than optimal), and 7 hours of maintenance (cooking, driving, hygiene) <br>
	16 waking hours, with 1 in morning, 3 at night, 1 for dinner, leaves 11 hours. 8 for main and 3 for side. <br>
	It gets a bit fuzzy, so probably max 70 hours a week I am working. <br>
	Could gain 7 more by reducing slop and going to be at 11pm and waking at 7am and getting ready immediately<br>
	You don't have to exactly follow this.  But this just gives general idea<br>

	

	<h2>Short-term concrete projects</h2>
	<ol>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Working on research project. Domain Randomization + Meta-Learning  
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">

<h2>Priorities</h2>
Anything not in this list should not be time wasted on
<div id="priorities">
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;">Do substantial research and projects in robotics and deep (reinforcement) learning to learn for the future </li>
        <li style="color: red;">Learn deep / reinforcement learning by reading and implementing</li>
		<li>Keep grades high enough for scholarship and grad school signalling  (GPA >= 3.6) </li>
        <li>Work on side DL and coding projects</li>
        <li>Get overall smarter and more productive</li>
        <li>Talk to more girls</li>
        <li>Gain weight</li>
        <li>Be fun to talk to and be around</li>
        <li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Anti-priorities</h2>

<div id="anti">
  These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a 
  lot of time and a net negative effect on progress.  
  Unless actions are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should 
  not be done.  It is good to explore a bit, but not much, and these are just 
  entropic, and time is so limited.
    <ul>
        <li>reddit</li>
		<li>News (besides that which should be common knowledge)</li>
		<li>Generally, any more than the minimum amount of work to get an A- in a class</li>
    </ul>
</div>
	<h2>Mantra</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			More than anything, you must be thinking of achieving your goal.  Whatever the means.
		</li>
		<li>
			Stay laser focused on RL and DL
		</li>
		<li>
			There are bigger fish to fry. [if you are dwelling on trvial things]
		</li>
		<li>
			Do things others donâ€™t do but should.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Start with the most important thing or it might not get done
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work" -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something." -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have." -pg
		</li>
		realized a lot of these were pg. oh well
