	<h2>Short-term concrete projects</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
		Getting an opportunity for this summer (1st choice work in Tucker's lab. have to find out next or I need to make backup plan quick)
		</li>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Tuning rock detector project and getting it to really work. Until you run out of things to improve.
		</li>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Implement RL algos (basics to PPO, ES) from scratch (in np and tf) to learn them well
		</li>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Read through the Goodfellow and Sutton books
		</li>
		<li style="color:blue;">
		Working on software for robotics club (simulation, high-level autonomy, sensors)
		</li>
		<li>
		Produce a simple document to give lay of the land on how to get started with DL or RL, gym
		</li>
		<li>
		Bullet modder (at least for textures)?
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Bookmarks</h2>
	<ul id="bookmark">
		<li>
			<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html">Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research</a>
<span class="extra"> (looks like a good introduction to using Tensorflow (better than anything on the TF website))</span>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mantra</h2>
	<ul>
		<li style="color:red;">
		  Start with the most important thing or it might not get done
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work" -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something." -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have." -pg
		</li>
		realized a lot of these were pg. oh well
	</ul>

<h2>Priorities</h2>
Anything not in this list should not be time wasted on
<div id="priorities">
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;">Learn deep / reinforcement learning by reading and implementing</li>
        <li>Work on longer term projects in DL/DRL</li>
        <li>Keep scholarship</li>
        <li>Make the Utah robotics team successful</li>
        <li>Work on robotics and coding projects</li>
        <li>Talk to more girls</li>
        <li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial</li>
        <li>Be fun to talk to and be around</li>
        <li>Gain weight</li>
        <li>Get overall smarter and more productive</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Anti-priorities</h2>

<div id="anti">
These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a 
lot of time.  Unless things are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should 
not be used.  It is good to explore a bit, but not much.  Doing the direct thing
that is a priority is the most important.  You don't learn to write code by 
reading about it.  You learn by actually writing code.  You have to dedicate 
specific time to it.  You should be able to learn to do these things without 
having to "expand your horizons".  For talking to people: just be interested 
in them.  That is all you need to do.

    <ul>
