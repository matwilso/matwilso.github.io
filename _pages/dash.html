	<h2>Daily regimen</h2>

	<p>This is ideal, but feel free to pull audibles and work on whatever you think it is best to work on, 
	but if you can't think of anything or you are lost, do this.</p>

	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Week day (MON-THU)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Wake up and study RL or DL (reading book or implementing) for 2 hours (8-10am)
		</li>
		<li>
		Work on schoolwork from 10am-7pm. 
		</li>
		<li>
		Other projects that are important (ad hoc)
		</li>
		<li>
		Get to the gym to climb, and maybe lift and run, every Tuesday at approx 8 or 9 pm.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Weekend (FRI-SUN)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Never work on any school work if you can manage (starting to maybe rethink this a bit)
		</li>
		<li>
		Work on most important project and try to save large chunks of time for working
		</li>
		<li>
		Saturday: research
		</li>
		<li>
		Sunday: robotics team
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Short-term concrete projects</h2>
	<ol>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Working on research project in Hermans lab. Implementing GPS and getting it to work on the real robot 
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">
		Tuning rock detector project and getting it to really work. Until you run out of things to improve.
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">
		Implement RL algos (basics to PPO, ES) from scratch (in np and tf) to learn them well
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">
		Read through the Goodfellow and Sutton books
		</li>
		<li style="color:#64B5F6;">
		Working on software for robotics club (simulation, high-level autonomy, sensors)
		</li>
		<li>
		Produce a simple document to give lay of the land on how to get started with DL or RL, gym
		</li>
		<li>
		Contributing to hypothes.is to fix that one bug and add notes to mine or the whole thing
		</li>
		<li>
		Bullet modder (at least for textures)?
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Bookmarks</h2>
	<ul id="bookmark">
		<li>
			<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html">Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research</a>
<span class="extra"> (looks like a good introduction to using Tensorflow (better than anything on the TF website))</span>
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://rll.berkeley.edu/cs287/lecture_videos/">Lecture videos for Cal Advanced Robotics - Abbeel</a>
<span class="extra">Good lectures by Pieter, should try to watch a few of these a week</span>
		</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>Mantra</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Do things others donâ€™t do but should.
		</li>
		<li style="color:red;">
		  Start with the most important thing or it might not get done
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work" -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something." -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have." -pg
		</li>
		realized a lot of these were pg. oh well

        <li>Get research experience</li>
        <li>Work on longer term projects in DL/DRL</li>
        <li>Keep scholarship</li>
        <li>Make the Utah robotics team successful</li>
        <li>Work on robotics and coding projects</li>
        <li>Talk to more girls</li>
        <li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial</li>
        <li>Be fun to talk to and be around</li>

        <li>Get overall smarter and more productive</li>

<h2>Anti-priorities</h2>

<div id="anti">
  These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a 
  lot of time and a net negative effect on progress.  
  Unless actions are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should 
  not be done.  It is good to explore a bit, but not much.  Doing the direct thing
  that is a priority is the most important.  You don't learn to write code by 
  reading about it.  You learn by actually writing code.  You have to dedicate 
  specific time to it.  You should be able to learn to do these things without 
  having to "expand your horizons".  For example, in talking to people, you don't
  need to know everything going on at this point; you just need to be interested 
  in them. That is all you need to do.
    <ul>
        <li>reddit</li>
		<li>News (besides that which should be common knowledge</li>
		<li>Any more than the minimum amount of work to get an A- in a class (unless you like it a lot)</li>
