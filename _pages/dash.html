	<h2>Daily regimen</h2>

	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Week (MON-SAT)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Wake up and get down to the lab (8-9am approximately)
		</li>
		<li>
		Work on research from 9am-8pm (about 11 hours a day). 
		</li>
		<li>
		Work on studying RL and working on Pommerman from 8pm-12pm (about 4 hours a day. may get cut short for misc reading). 
		</li>
		<li>
		Get to the gym to climb, and maybe lift and run, every Wednesday and Friday at approx 6pm.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Weekend (SUN)</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Not sure yet. Maybe spend more time on other projects like Pommerman, or just do the same thing as other days.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Short-term concrete projects</h2>
	<ol>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Working on research project. Implementing GPS and getting it to work on the real robot 
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">
		Work on training agents for Pommerman
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">
		Implement RL algos (basics to PPO, ES) from scratch (in np and tf) to learn them well
		</li>
		<li style="color:#2196F3;">
		Read through the Goodfellow and Sutton books
		</li>
		<li>
		Xandem work maybe
		</li>
		<li>
		Tuning rock detector project and getting it to really work. Until you run out of things to improve.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Mantra</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Stay laser focused on RL and DL
		</li>
		<li>
		There are bigger fish to fry. [if you are dwelling on trvial things]
		</li>
		<li>
		Do things others donâ€™t do but should.
		</li>
		<li>
		  Start with the most important thing or it might not get done
		</li>

		  "Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work" -pg

		<li>
		  "Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something." -pg
		</li>
		<li>
		  "Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have." -pg

<h2>Priorities</h2>
Anything not in this list should not be time wasted on
<div id="priorities">
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;">Do substantial research and projects in robotics and deep (reinforcement) learning to learn for the future and genuinely boost applications</li>
        <li style="color: red;">Learn deep / reinforcement learning by reading and implementing</li>
        <li>Keep scholarship</li>
        <li>Work on side DL and coding projects</li>
        <li>Talk to more girls</li>
        <li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial</li>
        <li>Be fun to talk to and be around</li>
        <li>Gain weight</li>
        <li>Get overall smarter and more productive</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2>Anti-priorities</h2>

<div id="anti">
  These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a 
  lot of time and a net negative effect on progress.  
  Unless actions are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should 
  not be done.  It is good to explore a bit, but not much.  Doing the direct thing
  that is a priority is the most important.  You don't learn to write code by 
  reading about it.  You learn by actually writing code.  You have to dedicate 
  specific time to it.  You should be able to learn to do these things without 
  having to "expand your horizons".  For example, in talking to people, you don't
  need to know everything going on at this point; you just need to be interested 
  in them. That is all you need to do.
    <ul>
        <li>reddit</li>
		<li>News (besides that which should be common knowledge</li>
		<li>Any more than the minimum amount of work to get an A- in a class (unless you like it a lot)</li>
