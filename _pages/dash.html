This was created in an earlier time.  I will have to see if I still think it makes sense.  Maybe it is a good thing to pull from my past.

	<div class="dash" id="prior" style="display: inline-block; width: 50%; float: left;">
		<h2>Priorities</h2>
		Anything not in this list should not be time wasted on
		<div id="priorities">
			<ul>
				<li style="color: red;">Research project and ideas </li>
				<li style="color: red;">Work on blog post</li>
				<li>Survive classes and TA with minimum effort </li>

				<li>Be interesting and funny and fun to talk to and be around</li>
				<li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial. Phase out ones that are not</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>Anti-priorities</h2>
		<div id="anti">
			These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a
			lot of time and a net negative effect on progress.
			Unless actions are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should
			not be done. It is good to explore a bit, but not much, and these are just
			entropic, and time is so limited.
			<ul>
				<li>reddit</li>
				<li>YouTube</li>
				<li>News (besides that which should be common knowledge)</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<div id="goals">
			<h2>Year</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Find interesting project to work on and make some cool things happen (finish a paper)</li>
				<li>Publish a blog post</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h2>Mantra</h2>
		<div id="mantra">
			<ul>
				<li>
					More than anything, you must be thinking of achieving your goal. Whatever the means.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do things others donâ€™t do but should.
				</li>
				<li>
					Start with the most important thing or it might not get done
				</li>
				<li>
					"Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work" -pg
				</li>
				<li>
					"Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay
					happy, you have to do something." -pg
				</li>
				<li>
					"Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have." -pg
				</li>
				realized a lot of these were pg. oh well
