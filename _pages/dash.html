	<h2>Short-term projects</h2>
	<ol>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Build my PC and start running my rock_detector model and other models
		</li>
		<li style="color:blue;">
		Implement PPO and state-of-the-art RL algos (in TensorFlow)
		</li>
		<li>
		Produce a tutorial or some document on how to get started
		</li>
		<li>
		Read through the Goodfellow and Sutton books
		</li>
		<li>
		Bullet modder (at least for textures)?
		</li>
		<li>
		Planning and preparing for my summer

	</ol>

	<h2>Bookmarks</h2>
	<ul id="bookmark">
		<li>
			<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html">Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research</a>
<span class="extra"> (looks like a good introduction to using Tensorflow (better than anything on the TF website))</span>

	<h2>Mantra</h2>
	<ul>
		<li style="color:red;">
		Start with the most important thing or it might not get done
		</li>
		<li>
			"Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work"
		</li>
		<li>
		Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.

<h2>Priorities</h2>
Anything not in this list should not be time wasted on
<div id="priorities">
    <ul>
        <li style="color: red;">Learn deep (reinforcement) learning</li>
        <li>Keep scholarship</li>
        <li>Make the Utah robotics team successful</li>
        <li>Work on robotics and coding projects</li>
        <li>Talk to more girls</li>
        <li>Gain weight</li>
        <li>Maintain relationships that you feel are beneficial</li>
        <li>Be fun to talk to and be around</li>
        <li>Getting overall smarter and more productive</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Anti-priorities</h2>

<div id="anti">
These things should specifically not be done. They have been shown to waste a 
lot of time.  Unless things are pertinent to one of the priorities, they should 
not be used.  It is good to explore a bit, but not much.  Doing the direct thing
that is a priority is the most important.  You don't learn to write code by 
reading about it.  You learn by actually writing code.  You have to dedicate 
specific time to it.  You should be able to learn to do these things without 
having to "expand your horizons".  For talking to people: just be interested 
in them.  That is all you need to do.

    <ul>
        <li>reddit</li>
		<li>News (besides that which should be common knowledge</li>
		<li>Any more than the minimum amount of work to get an A- in a class</li>
