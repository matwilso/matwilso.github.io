title: NASA Robotic Mining Competition
permalink: /rmc/
---

The idea behind this competition is to
develop robots for a simulated off world mining mission.
Robots are placed in an arena of Lunar Regolith (dirt) simulant and have
to drive across the field to collect dirt and subsurface gravel/ice and deposit
it into a bin.  In a real Mars or Lunar mission, the water in this material would 
be extracted for rocket fuel, water for plants, and whatever else water is good for.
