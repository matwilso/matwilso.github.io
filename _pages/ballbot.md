The ballbots–invented by Ralph back in '05–are a cool type of robot.
They balance on a single ball at their base and actively keep their balance
by sensing their lean angle and driving the ball to correct any tilts.  They
can balance extremely well.  You can push them and jerk them around and
they will stay balanced.


The really interesting part about the ballbots is how
good they are around humans.  They can move around and do a lot of
things that other robots do, but they are also extremely compliant.  You can
push them around and easily bump them out of the way as you are walking.  This
is because they are dynamically stable.  Like humans, they must
actively balance to stay up and so they are not rigid and can be pushed
and moved pretty easily and safely.


My work was on adding a speech interface and vision system to the newer, smaller
ballbot, called Shmoobot.  Shmoo has an Amazon Echo Dot and Astra RGB-D camera
for speech and vision.  The idea for my project was that a user could give the robot a
command to: "Go to the office, look what's on the table, come back to the lab.
Tell me what you saw." It went pretty well.
