The original Ballbot (in the background of the image) was invented by Ralph Hollis
in '05.  I was working on the smaller ballbot (in the foreground).  It was called
Shmoobot.

Ballbots are pretty interesting because they are dynamically stable; they have
to constantly actuate their motors to balance, kind of like humans.
This makes them very compliant.  You can push them around and easily 
bump them out of the way as you are walking.

I was surprised at how well they balance.  Like they actually work and you can bump
them around and they don't tip over.  They are pretty robust.

I was still always nervous though that something would go wrong.
, because they would 
instantly fall if it did.

In order to balance, they have an inertial measurement unit on board that 
senses their lean angle and actuates motors with rollers on the ball to
correct any tilts.  

They can move around and do a lot of
things that other robots do, but they are also extremely compliant.  You can
push them around and easily bump them out of the way as you are walking.  This
is because they are dynamically stable.  Like humans, they must
actively balance to stay up and so they are not rigid and can be pushed
and moved pretty easily and safely.

My work was on adding a speech interface and vision system to Shmoobot.  It has 
an Amazon Echo Dot and Astra RGB-D camera for speech and vision.  The idea for 
my project was that a user could give the robot a
command to: "Go to the office, look what's on the table, come back to the lab.
Tell me what you saw." It went pretty well.
