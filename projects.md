## Robotics research internship at Carnegie Mellon
<span style="color: grey">Summer 2017</span>


This past summer, I was part of the [RISS] (Robotics Institute Summer
Scholards) program at Carnegie Mellon University.  RISS is a program for
undergraduate students from all around the world to come to CMU and work and
do research in a robotics lab with professors and graduate students for a summer.

I was working in the Microdynamic Systems Lab ([MSL][msl]) with Ralph Hollis
and Jean Oh on adding a speech and vision system to one of the ballbots.  The
ballbots were invented by Ralph back in '05, and are a cool type of robot.
They balance on a ball by driving two sets of parallel rollers and are
very compliant. You can push them around or bump into them, and they stay
balanced and are gentle, so they are good robots for being around humans.


My work was on adding a speech interface and vision system to the newer, smaller
ballbot, called Shmoobot.  The idea would be that a user could give the robot a
command to: "Go to the office, look what's on the table, come back to the lab.
Tell me what you saw."  Shmoo has an Amazon Echo Dot and Astra RGB-D camera
for speech and vision.
