I am a first year masters student in computer science at the [University of 
British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), working on robotics and reinforcement
\+ deep learning, advised by [Michiel van de Panne](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/).  Previously, I worked on similar things for my undergraduate 
thesis at the University of Utah (2019) as a member of the [LL4MA lab](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/), advised by [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans).
