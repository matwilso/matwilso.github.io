I am a second year masters student in computer science at the [University of 
British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), working on robotics and reinforcement
\+ deep learning, advised by [Michiel van de Panne](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/).  Previously, I worked on similar things for my undergraduate 
thesis at the University of Utah (2019) as a member of the [LL4MA lab](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/), advised by [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans). 

I graduate in May 2021 and I am in the job market.

# Robots

These are the robots I have experience working with.
On the lower row are three of the robots I helped build and program for [Utah's](http://usr.coe.utah.edu/) NASA [Robotic Mining Competition (RMC)](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc/about) team.

# Past Projects

<br>
**[2015-2018] Utah Student Robotics Team Member**

During undergrad at the U, I got into robotics and worked on the [Utah team](http://usr.coe.utah.edu/) on the [NASA Robotic Mining Competition](https://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/centers/kennedy/technology/nasarmc.html) for 3 years of competition.
We had some great robots and consistently placed well in the competition. It was a lot of fun.
<!--S/o to john robe, jon davies, cole mortensen, katie hall, dave purcell, justin schramm, and all the others who worked on the project and continue to carry on the torch.

**[2017] Robotics Institute Summer Scholar @ Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**

I spent Summer 2017 as part of the [Robotics Institute Summer Scholar (RISS) program](https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/),
which gives undergraduates from other universities experience working on robotics and machine learning research in great CMU labs.
I had the great pleasure of working with [Ralph Hollis](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/rhollis/www/home.html), [Jean Oh](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./jeanoh/), and [Roberto Shu](https://rshum19.github.io./) on getting one of the [ballbots](http://www.msl.ri.cmu.edu/projects/ballbot/) to recognize commands, navigate in a building, recognize objects, and report back about what it saw.


You can check my CV for more details on these projects.
