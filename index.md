# Bio

I am a junior computer engineering student at the University of Utah,
graduating in May 2019.  This past summer I
worked at Carnegie Mellon University as part of the
Robotics Institute Summer Scholars ([RISS]) program.  In the [MSL lab][msl],
I worked on adding a vision system and speech interface to command the
[ballbots].


I am also a core contributor to the [Utah robotics club][club], which competes in
the [NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa] each May at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Last year, I developed a lot of the [software] for the robot and was the
primary author on the [Systems Engineering][paper] [Paper][3rd] for the NASA
competition, helping us get us 3rd place (on the paper and overall). This year
I am the software team lead and am hoping to help the team achieve its first
fully autonomous run at the competition.


See my [Projects] page for more details.
