## Bio

I am first year masters student in computer science at the [University of 
British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/), working on robotics and reinforcement
\+ deep learning, advised by [Michiel van de Panne](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/).  Previously, I worked on similar things for my undergraduate 
thesis at the University of Utah (2019) as a member of the [LL4MA lab](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/), advised by [Tucker Hermans](https://robot-learning.cs.utah.edu/thermans). 
In 2017, I was a summer intern at the Robotics Institute ([RISS])
at Carnegie Mellon University working with Ralph Hollis and Jean Oh
in the the [MSL lab][msl] with the [ballbots].
In the past, I was a member of the Utah robotics club, competing in the
[NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa] for 3 years each May at Kennedy Space Center 
in Florida.

### News
- In November 2018, I released my implementations of [Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) in numpy](https://github.com/matwilso/maml_numpy), [Domain Randomization for Sim-to-Real adaptation](https://github.com/matwilso/domrand), and [Relation Networks for a toy state estimation task](https://github.com/matwilso/relation-networks).
- In June 2018, I wrote up an answer to a [stackoverflow question on PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46422845/what-is-the-way-to-understand-proximal-policy-optimization-algorithm-in-rl/50663200#50663200)

Summer 2017, I was part of the [RISS] (Robotics Institute Summer
Scholars) program at Carnegie Mellon University.  RISS is a program for
undergraduate students from around the world to go to CMU and work on
research in a robotics lab for a summer.
As part of the RISS program, I worked on adding an object detection
and natural language communication system to one of the [ballbots][ballbot].
I presented my research as a [poster] and a [paper][riss_paper]. The ballbots
are all running ROS, and I worked a lot with the prior software system for 
low-level control and navigation, and I also developed a lot in ROS 
(w/ Python and C++).

## NASA Robotic Mining Competition


From 2015-2018, I competed with the [Utah Student Robotics club][club] in the
[NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa].  

I worked on the programming side of the team and developed a lot of the [software]
for 2017-18 year, including low-level sensor and motor ROS drivers,
Gazebo [robot](https://github.com/matwilso/emcee_simulation) [simulation](https://github.com/utahrobotics/usr_simulation),
localization using [visual markers](https://github.com/utahrobotics/aruco_pkgs),
and high-level [autonomy](https://github.com/utahrobotics/usr_ws/tree/kinetic-devel/src/amee_controllers#competition_smach) (finite state machine). In the 2017-18 year, I was the software team lead.

<br>
At the 2018 competition, we ended up getting 3rd overall.




<span style="color: grey">2017</span> <br>
<img src="/assets/urmp/emcee_2017.png" alt="2017" width="360">

At the 2017 competition, our team got [3rd place](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/rmc2017_scoresummary.pdf) 
out of about 50 schools.  I worked on motor controller code and robot simulation (ROS/Gazebo). 
I was also the primary author on the [Systems Engineering][se_paper] [Paper][3rd] 
for the NASA competition for which we got 3rd place.

<span style="color: grey">2016</span>

<img src="/assets/urmp/emcee_2016.png" alt="robot" width="360">

At the 2016 competition, our team dug the most regolith out of any team. Our
robot was really heavy though and that is unfortunately a bad thing for
escaping Earth's gravity well and also for NASA competition point penalties. We
ended up getting like 7th overall or something.  This year I was a mechanical
engineer (before switching my major) and worked on the Solidworks models
and other general stuff while learning to code.
