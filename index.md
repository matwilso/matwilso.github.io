## Bio

I am a junior computer engineering student at the University of Utah,
graduating in May 2019, interested in robotics and deep learning.
I have worked on several robotics projects in the past and am currently getting
into reinforcement + deep learning.
This past summer (2017), I was a Robotics Insititue Summer Scholar ([RISS])
at Carnegie Mellon University working with Ralph Hollis and Jean Oh
in the the [MSL lab][msl] with the [ballbots]. I am also
a core contributor to the Utah robotics club, which competes in the
[NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa] each May at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.


See more details below.

This past summer, I was part of the [RISS] (Robotics Institute Summer
Scholars) program at Carnegie Mellon University.  RISS is a program for
undergraduate students from around the world to come to CMU and work and
do research in a robotics lab with professors and graduate students for a summer.
As part of the RISS program, I worked on adding an object detection
and natural language communication system to one of the [ballbots][ballbot].
I presented my research as a [poster] and a [paper][riss_paper]. The ballbots
are all running ROS, and I worked a lot with the prior software system for 
low-level control and navigation, and I also developed a lot in ROS 
(w/ Python and C++).

## NASA Robotic Mining Competition


Each year I compete with the [Utah Student Robotics club][club] in the
[NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa].

I work on the programming side of the team and developed a lot of the [software]
last year, including low-level sensor and motor ROS drivers,
Gazebo [robot](https://github.com/matwilso/emcee_simulation) [simulation](https://github.com/utahrobotics/usr_simulation),
localization using [visual markers](https://github.com/utahrobotics/aruco_pkgs),
and high-level [autonomy](https://github.com/utahrobotics/usr_ws/tree/kinetic-devel/src/amee_controllers#competition_smach) (finite state machine). This year I am the software team lead
and am hoping to help the team get its first fully autonomous run at the competition.

Stay tuned...

At the 2017 competition, our team got [3rd place](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/rmc2017_scoresummary.pdf) out of about 50 schools.  I was also the primary author on the
[Systems Engineering][se_paper] [Paper][3rd] for the NASA
competition for which we got 3rd place.

At the 2016 competition, our team dug the most regolith out of any team. Our
robot was really heavy though and that is unfortunately a bad thing for
escaping Earth's gravity well and also for NASA competition point penalties. We
ended up getting like 7th overall or something.  This year I was a mechanical
engineer (before switching my major and joining the light side) and worked on the Solidworks models
and other general stuff while learning to code.
