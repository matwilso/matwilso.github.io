In 2017, I was a summer intern at the Robotics Institute ([RISS])
at Carnegie Mellon University working with Ralph Hollis and Jean Oh
in the the [MSL lab][msl] with the [ballbots].
In the beginning of time, I was a member of the University of Utah robotics club, competing in the
[NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa] for 3 years each May at Kennedy Space Center 
in Florida.

Summer 2017, I was part of the [RISS] (Robotics Institute Summer
Scholars) program at Carnegie Mellon University.  RISS is a program for
undergraduate students from around the world to go to CMU and work on
research in a robotics lab for a summer.
As part of the RISS program, I worked on adding an object detection
and natural language communication system to one of the [ballbots][ballbot].
I presented my research as a [poster] and a [paper][riss_paper]. The ballbots
are all running ROS, and I worked a lot with the prior software system for 
low-level control and navigation, and I also developed a lot in ROS 
(w/ Python and C++).

## NASA Robotic Mining Competition


From 2015-2018, I competed with the [Utah Student Robotics club][club] in the
[NASA Robotic Mining Competition][nasa].  

I worked on the programming side of the team and developed a lot of the [software]
for 2017-18 year, including low-level sensor and motor ROS drivers,
Gazebo [robot](https://github.com/matwilso/emcee_simulation) [simulation](https://github.com/utahrobotics/usr_simulation),
localization using [visual markers](https://github.com/utahrobotics/aruco_pkgs),
and high-level [autonomy](https://github.com/utahrobotics/usr_ws/tree/kinetic-devel/src/amee_controllers#competition_smach) (finite state machine). In the 2017-18 year, I was the software team lead.

At the 2018 competition, we ended up getting 3rd overall.

At the 2017 competition, our team got [3rd place](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/rmc2017_scoresummary.pdf) 
out of about 50 schools.  I worked on motor controller code and robot simulation (ROS/Gazebo). 
I was also the primary author on the [Systems Engineering][se_paper] [Paper][3rd] 
for the NASA competition for which we got 3rd place.

At the 2016 competition, our team dug the most regolith out of any team. Our
robot was really heavy though and that is unfortunately a bad thing for
escaping Earth's gravity well and also for NASA competition point penalties. We
ended up getting like 7th overall or something.  This year I was a mechanical
engineer (before switching my major) and worked on the Solidworks models
and other general stuff while learning to code.
